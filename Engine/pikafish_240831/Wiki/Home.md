[Pikafish](https://pikafish.org/) is a **free, open source, and strong UCI xiangqi engine** derived from Stockfish that analyzes xiangqi positions and computes the optimal moves. 

Pikafish **does not include a graphical user interface** (GUI) that is required to display a xiangqi board and to make it easy to input moves. Several [Free GUIs](Download-and-usage#free) are developed independently from Pikafish and are available online. 
**Read the documentation for your GUI** of choice for information about how to use Pikafish with it.
